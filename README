DESCRIPTION
    TODO

ALGORITHM IN SHORT
    TODO

INSTALLATION
    Please see the INSTALL file in this distribution. As a minimum please be
    aware of the following access restrictions:

    App::Webauth needs access to iptables(8) and ipset(8) to change the
    firewall-rules on request. You must add the following rule (or similar)
    to the sudoers file, depending on the username of your http daemon:

     WWW_USER ALL=NOPASSWD: /PATH/TO/iptables, /PATH/TO/ipset

    The default $SESSIONS_DIR is set to '/var/cache/webauth'.

    WWW_USER must be the owner of this dir with write permissions!

CONFIGURATION
    The configuration file is searched in the following default places:

        $ENV{APP_WEBAUTH_CONFIG} ||
        $Bin/../etc/local/config.pl ||
        $Bin/../etc/config.pl

LOGGING
    Logging is handled by the Log::Log4perl module. The logging
    configuration is searched in the following default places:

        $ENV{APP_WEBAUTH_LOG4PERL}   ||
        $Bin/../etc/local/log4perl.conf ||
        $Bin/../etc/log4perl.conf

LOCAL ADAPTATION
    The HTML files are generated from templates (Template-Toolkit syntax).
    You should use the original template files as stanzas and put the
    locally changed versions into the local template tree. The template
    search order prefers the local templates.

    The CSS is based on the wonderful blueprint css framework, see
    <http://www.blueprintcss.org/>. Of course you may use your own styles if
    needed.

    The firewall rules and commands are also generated from template files.
    Normally there is no need to change the firewall rules but it would be
    possible to add some local needed additional rules without changing the
    perl code. Be careful, you must understand the algorithm and the
    different states. Best you ask the author for any modifications.

I18N
    There exists a template tree for each supported language. Some
    system/error messages used by the program must also be translated for
    the message catalog in the config file.
